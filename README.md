# Problem Statement

You are tasked with building a service in node.js or golang that allows players of an online game
to submit feedback for their last game session, and allows members of an operations team to
view the feedback.
Users can give their session a rating on a scale of 1 to 5, and can leave a comment. Multiple
players can rate the same session, but each player can only rate a given session once.

Following RESTful principles, create HTTP endpoints to allow:

● Players to add feedback for a session

● Ops team members to see recent feedback left by players, allowing filtering by rating


If you find you have time and would like to do more, consider adding any of the following:

● a simple front-end

● database design / persistence

● tests

● deployment scripts/tools

● authentication

● user permissions

● ...or anything else that strikes your fancy




General Guidelines

● We expect this exercise to take a few (1-4) hours to complete.

● The requirements are fairly abstract so feel free to make assumptions as necessary and
document those assumptions as you see fit. This isn’t intended to be an exercise in
requirements gathering, but we would like to see how you reason about things.

● Feel free to use any frameworks or third-party libraries you like, as long as they are not
restricted for commercial use.
